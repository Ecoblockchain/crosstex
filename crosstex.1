and

.PP
CrossTeX
is a modern object-oriented bibliography management tool, designed to replace
BibTeX.
It comprises a new bibliographic database format that is much less prone to
error compared to other alternatives like
BibTeX ,
and a new tool for creating the citations that appear at the end of scholarly
texts that is very flexible.
.PP
In addition to the ability to process bibliographic databases as an assistant
to
.BR latex ,
using the same invocation idiom as
.BR bibtex ,
.B crosstex
may be invoked under the following aliases:
.TP
.B xtx2html
Convert a database to HTML, for example for inclusion of a personal publication
database in a home page.
.TP
.B xtx2bib
Back-convert a CrossTeX database to use only BibTeX constructs in case
processing with BibTeX is required by a publisher.
.TP
.B bib2xtx
Optimize an old-style BibTeX database to take advantage of advanced CrossTeX
features such as @default statements; useful for converting large old databases
in an automatic pass.
