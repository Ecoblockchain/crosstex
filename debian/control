Description: modern object-oriented bibliography management tool
 CrossTeX is a modern, object-oriented bibliography management tool,
 designed to replace BibTex. It comprises a new bibliographic database
 format that is much less prone to error compared to other alternatives
 like BibTex, and a new tool for creating the citations that appear at
 the end of scholarly texts that is very flexible.
